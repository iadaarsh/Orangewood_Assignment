Aquarium Object Detection with YOLOv8
This repository contains code for training a YOLOv8 object detection model on the Aquarium dataset, specifically targeting coral reef conservation. The project leverages Roboflow for dataset preprocessing and Google Colab for model training. Key metrics like precision, recall, and mean Average Precision (mAP) are used to evaluate model performance.

Overview
This project uses the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once, Version 8) deep learning model for object detection in an aquarium dataset. The YOLOv8 model is particularly efficient for real-time object detection tasks and can be customized for various applications, including marine life conservation.

Dataset
The Aquarium Dataset is used for training and testing the model. This dataset includes images of marine life in aquariums, annotated with bounding boxes to identify specific objects like fish, coral, and other underwater objects.

Source: Kaggle - Aquarium Data COTS
Classes: Multiple object classes including fish and coral.
Annotations: Bounding boxes in YOLO format.
Installation
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/aquarium-object-detection.git
cd aquarium-object-detection
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install ultralytics
Optional: Set up Google Colab for training.

Usage
Download Dataset: Set up a Roboflow account and download the dataset from Roboflow or Kaggle.

Configure Dataset: Place the dataset inside the data/ folder, and ensure annotations are in the correct YOLO format.

Model Configuration: Use YOLOv8's pretrained model weights, like yolov8n.pt for a nano model, to start training.

Training
To train the model, run the following code in a Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook environment:

python
Copy code
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load YOLOv8 model
model = YOLO('yolov8n.pt')  # Choose model size, e.g., yolov8s, yolov8m, yolov8l for larger models

# Train the model
model.train(data='data/dataset.yaml', epochs=50, imgsz=640)
Adjust epochs and imgsz as needed to optimize training.

Evaluation
After training, validate the model to evaluate its performance on the validation set.

python
Copy code
# Validate the model
metrics = model.val()

# Print metrics
print(f"Precision: {metrics['precision']}")
print(f"Recall: {metrics['recall']}")
print(f"mAP@50: {metrics['map50']}")
print(f"mAP@50-95: {metrics['map']}")
Key metrics include:

Precision
Recall
mAP@50
mAP@50-95
Results
The model outputs predictions for test images, which can be visualized to assess model accuracy. Below are example results:

Precision: XX%
Recall: XX%
mAP@50: XX%
mAP@50-95: XX%
Example Visualizations
After running the predictions, visualize sample outputs to understand the model's effectiveness.

python
Copy code
model.show('data/test_images')  # Specify path to test images
